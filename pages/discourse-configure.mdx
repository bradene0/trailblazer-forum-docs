# Configure Discourse

## 1. Access Droplet via SSH

Once the droplet is created, use SSH to connect to your droplet. Follow the instructions provided by DigitalOcean.

## 2. Run Discourse Setup Script

Execute the Discourse setup script by running the following commands:

```bash
cd /var/discourse
./discourse-setup`
```

## 3. Follow Setup Wizard

The setup wizard will guide you through various configuration options, including email settings and administrator account creation.

## 4. Configure Email (Optional)

If you haven't set up email during the initial Discourse setup, you can configure it later using the `./discourse-setup` script.

## 5. Rebuild Discourse

After configuring, run the following command to rebuild Discourse with the new settings:

```bash
cd /var/discourse
./launcher rebuild app
```
