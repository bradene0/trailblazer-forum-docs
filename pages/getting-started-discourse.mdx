# Getting Started with Discourse

After configuring the Discourse droplet and accessing its domain, you will be greeted by a congratulations screen with a single button:

Pressing the Register button will bring you to the admin account registration page. The email for the admin account is fixed and corresponds to the email you entered during Discourse configuration previously:

After you finished registering the admin account and confirming it, your Discourse is fully operational!

If it is your first time using Discourse, consider visiting the official getting started tutorials at [Discourse Official Getting Started Tutorials](https://blog.discourse.org/tag/getting-started/).
